        The History of Real Madrid
    </h1>
    <img class="rmlogo" src="./Images/real_madrid_1953.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
        Real Madrid CF has probably achieved all a football club could. With a record 33 La Liga titles, 19 Copa del Rey trophies, a sensational 13 European Cups/Champions Leagues and 2 UEFA Cups, Real are second to none in a competition for the greatest football club of all time. Real has been the most supported club in the country for the majority of its history. Many of the best players in the world have played in the clubs white shirts, including legends like Alfredo Di Stéfano and Ferenc Puskás.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though the club was founded in 1902, it was originally named Madrid Football Club; it wasn't until 1920 that King Alfonso XIII bestowed them with the title of "real" – or "royal" in English. These early years were reasonably successful for Real, as evidenced by their four consecutive Copa del Rey victories from 1905 to 1908. By the outbreak of the WWII, Real could boast with two La Liga titles and seven Copa del Rey trophies.

                <b> GK:  Iker Casillas </b> <br>
             During 16 glorious seasons at Real Madrid, Casillas kept an impressive 264 clean sheets in 725 appearances in all competitions, despite the Merengues not being particularly renowned for having the meanest of defences.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="column2">
            <p>  <img src="./images resized/rsz_real-madrid-greatest-xi-roberto-carlos.jpg" alt=""> <br>
                <b> LB : Roberto Carlos </b> <br>
                Roberto Carlos is arguably the most offensive left-back in the history of the sport. During 11 successful seasons at Real Madrid, the Brazilian scored an impressive 70 goals and provided 88 assists in over 500 appearances in all competitions for the club. </p>
    </div>
        <div class="column3">
            <p>  <img src="./images resized/rsz_real-madrid-greatest-xi-jose-santamaria.jpg"> <br>
                <b> CB : Jose Santamaria </b> <br>
                He was nicknamed The Wall during his playing days, and with good reason. Santamaria was the often impenetrable last line of defence for the great Real Madrid team of the late 50s and early 60s. He featured 337 times for Los Blancos and lifted the European Cup 4 times. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column4">
        <p>  <img src="./images resized/rsz_real-madrid-greatest-xi-fernando-hierro.jpg"> <br>
            <b> CB : Fernando Hierro </b> <br>
            Hierro was a sublime defender, with great positioning sense, anticipation and aerial ability. He was very comfortable on the ball, and had a great range of passing, often starting moves for his team. And he had a fearsome shot, which helped him score an incredible 127 goals in his 601 appearances for Real.</p>
</div>
<div class="column5">
    <p>  <img src="./images resized/rsz_1real-madrid-greatest-xi-chendo.jpg"> <br>
        <b> RB : Chendo </b> <br>
        Chendo spent his entire career at Real Madrid. He was an extremely dedicated player who stood out for his hard work and commitment to the cause. The industrious right back spent 16 seasons at the club, winning 7 La Liga titles and the 1998 Champions League.</p>
</div>
<div class="column6">
    <p>  <img src="./images resized/rsz_real-madrid-greatest-xi-pirri.jpg"> <br>
        <b> LCM : Pirri </b> <br>
        José Martínez Sánchez, nicknamed Pirri, was known as the lungs of the Real Madrid team of the 60s and 70s. He was an incredibly versatile player who’s played as a central midfielder, defender, sweeper and even as a makeshift forward. He netted 172 goals during his 16 seasons with the club.</p>
</div>
<div class="column7">
    <p>  <img src="./images resized/rsz_real-madrid-greatest-xi-zinedine-zidane.jpg"> <br>
        <b> RCM : Zinedine Zidane </b> <br>
        One of the all-time greats of football, Zidane was always going to find his spot in this team. He played in a variety of positions throughout midfield during his Real Madrid career, but we’d like to play him centrally, getting him on the ball as often as possible. Few people have ever had a better range and eye for passing and he would be the man pulling the strings from midfield for this team.</p>
</div>
<div class="column8">
    <p>  <img src="./images resized/rsz_1real-madrid-greatest-xi-cristiano-ronaldo.jpg"> <br>
        <b> LW : Cristiano Ronaldo</b> <br>
        The talisman of the modern day Real Madrid team, Cristiano Ronaldo slots into his preferred position on the left wing. He thrives on good quality service, and there’ll be no shortage of that in this team. Cristiano is Real Madrid’s all time top goalscorer with a goal ratio of about 1 goal per game. He is the all time Champions League top goalscorer.</p>
</div>
<div class="column9">
    <p>  <img src="./images resized/rsz_real-madrid-greatest-xi-francisco-gento.jpg"> <br>
        <b> RW : Francisco Gento</b> <br>
        The legendary winger is now the honorary President of Real Madrid, following the passing away of Di Stefano. He appeared in a record 8 European finals for Real, winning a record 6. While he made his name playing mostly on the left wing, we had to give provide Cristiano Ronaldo the first dibs. So Gento occupies the right wing in this team.</p>
</div>
<div class="column10">
    <p>  <img src="./images resized/rsz_real-madrid-greatest-xi-alfredo-di-stefano.jpg"> <br>
        <b> CF : Alfredo Di Stefano</b> <br>
        The Godfather of Real Madrid occupies the no. 10 role in this XI. Today Real Madrid would not be Real Madrid without the contributions of arguably their greatest ever player, Alfredo Di Stefano. He was a true all-round player, and many of those who played with him swear even now that he’s the best they’ve ever seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="column11">
    <p>  <img src="./images resized/rsz_real-madrid-greatest-xi-ronaldo-nazario.jpg"> <br>
        <b> ST : Ronaldo Nazario</b> <br>
        With his incredible pace, power and skill, Ronaldo produced a series of memorable performances for the whites. And at the head of the lineup, he completes this illustrious starting XI.</p>
